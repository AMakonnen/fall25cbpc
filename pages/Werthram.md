# Frederic Werthram and The Senate Comic Book Hearings of 1954

Frederic Werthram, child psychologist and author of *Seduction of the Innocent*, was an outspoken voice when it came to the issues that he found prevalent in comic books. As the leading prosecution in The Senate Comic Book Hearings of 1954, he believed that the unsavory content of comics was going to negatively influence readers, particularly children. He cited that comics showed graphic depictions of violence, introduced children to negative practices, and promoted homosexuality, crime, adultery, and general perversion. He often stated that these behaviors were described in explicit detail as to facilitate emulation. The case of comics was defended by Gaines, under the preprotection of free speech in regards to creative fields and fiction. In addition to issues of content, Wertham voiced concern that traditional values were at risk, that comics were too accessible and influential, and that audiences would be too susceptible to the themes being depicted.
