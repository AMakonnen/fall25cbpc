# Romance Comics
Around 1947, romance comic books became greatly popular due to the release of “Young Romance” (Simon and Kirby) following World War II. The series “Young Romance” involves multiple short stories with different plots, each depicting a short story of love. The targeted audience was adults, and was one of the earliest comics specifically for female readers. Some of the plots include “sappy” love stories or a moral lesson learned at the end. Nonetheless, all of the stories finish with a happy ending, an ending of joy and love. In these romances, differences of class, moral values, education, religion, and more were shown and examined. Below, an image of the “Young Romance” cover is attached.
