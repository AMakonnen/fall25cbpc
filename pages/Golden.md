# The Golden Age of Comics
The Golden Age of Comics refers to the period of time in American comic book history from 1938 (with the first appearance of Superman) to 1954 (introduction of the Comics Code). This period is often characterized by the emergence of superheroes into mainstream media, vibrant and colorful artistic choices, and the post-WWII surge in popularity of crime and horror genres. 

This time was also defined by many patriotic heroes sporting red, white, and blue as a result of WWII and the sentiments surrounding it. Associated with the rise of patriotism brought about by WWII, many well-known superhero comics publishing companies originated during the Golden Age, including *Archie Comics*, *Detective Comics* (now known as *DC Comics*), and *Timely Comics* (later to become *Marvel Comics*), and gained popularity quickly!
