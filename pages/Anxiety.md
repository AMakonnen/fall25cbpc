Fear and Anxiety surrounding Moral Panic towards Juvenile Delinquency

Historical Context:
In the 1940s and 50s, fear and anxiety became central elements across many comic genres, including horror, crime, and even superhero stories. While horror relied on monsters and suspense, superheroes also began to mirror the cultural tensions of the Cold War. Once lighthearted and optimistic, superhero comics gradually adopted darker tones and art styles. For example, villains like Batman’s Scarecrow weaponized fear itself, while Superman’s unchecked power raised unsettling questions about control and trust in Metropolis (Duke University). Critics worried that these fear-driven stories would harm children more than straightforward violence, normalizing paranoia and distrust of authority. Fredric Wertham’s Seduction of the Innocent (1954) argued that comics encouraged fear, delinquency, and psychological instability (Wertham). Responding to this moral panic, the Comics Code Authority banned horror imagery and even scenes of “excessive suspense” (Comic Book Legal Defense Fund). These restrictions forced superhero comics to return to lighter themes and effectively ended the dominance of horror and crime titles that thrived on darker content (Vox).

Analyzing it in the context of Werthram/Senate Hearings:
One of the reasons for these hearings was the rise in juvenile delinquency, and the committee was set to determine the cause. Wertham insisted that comic books were to blame, though many experts disagreed. Gaines, in his testimony, asked:

“What are we afraid of? Are we afraid of our own children? Do we forget that they are citizens, too, and entitled to select what to read or do? Do we think our children are so evil, so simple minded, that it takes a story of murder to set them to murder, a story of robbery to set them to robbery?…I don’t believe anything that has ever been written can make a child overaggressive or delinquent. The roots of such characteristics are much deeper…The problems are economic and social and they are complex…” 

Gaines tried to steer the public away from blaming comics, framing the alleged negative effects as symptoms of broader societal issues. He believed the fear was unjustified and that comics were being made a scapegoat for larger problems. Following the hearing, however, public perception of comics worsened to the point where many writers and artists were embarrassed or afraid to admit their involvement. Between 1954 and 1956, about 400 titles were dropped and more than 800 creators lost their jobs. Marvel did not officially drop the Code until 2001, and DC and Archie followed suit ten years later in 2011, though restrictions had already begun to ease somewhat in the decades prior. 

Evaluate chosen comic books in light of the concern:
Tales of the Crypt 
This idea of moral panic within youth circles around fear of corruption. One point that was made was the accessibility of these comics like at a newsstand. So when looking at even just the cover of Tales Of The Crypt there could be a sense of fear and worry that these images might affect the growing of a younger generation. 

Close reading:
When analyzing a page from the comic book “Tales From The Crypt no. 42,” published by EC Comics, one can find that the concerns of those undergoing moral panic were not necessarily unjustified. On page 10 alone, the illustrations depict a man getting eaten alive by werewolves. The use of dark colors and dialogue contribute to the horrifying image. However, adding to the already morbid page, the werewolves make a joke about “the toothless old werewolf,” attempting to make light of the gross situation. 

The comic code violations in this page alone include A.6 (evil shall not triumph over good; the protagonist gets eaten), A.8 (weapons shall not be concealed in unique ways; a gun is concealed in a violin case), B.3 (gruesome images will be eliminated; it depicts the main character getting eaten pretty clearly, B.4 (stories with evil shall teach some kind of lesson; the story doesn’t), and B.5 (werewolves, vampires, and other monsters of the sort are prohibited; there are werewolves in the story); while the comic code was not implemented on comics until after the publication of “Tales of the Crypt no. 42,” it makes sense that people would be concerned by the imagery and how it could corrupt the youth.
