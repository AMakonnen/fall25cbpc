# Superhero Comics

The superhero theme is one of the most prominent themes in the comic book industry. Superhero comics also have tints of other themes such as horror, romance, comedy throughout the stories to help enrich the overall theme. 

Superhero comics typically begin with a tragic backstory in which the main character (superhero) experiences trauma, the loss of a loved one, or another horrible event. Such events shape the superhero’s ideals and morals, making them who they are on the inside. Most of these superheroes develop or are born with extraordinary abilities, often known as “superpowers,” that set them apart from the average person. These powers may include super speed, super strength, or even telepathic abilities. The rest of the superheroes build their own power through technology, wealth, or status—for example, Iron Man or Batman.

Superheroes use their powers to fight criminals and villains or to provide assistance to helpless people in their cities. Their actions can range from simple tasks, such as saving a cat from a tree, to epic battles against villains with similar powers. This often portrays the police force as weak in comparison to superheroes, leading society to place greater faith in heroes than in law enforcement. As a result, a common theme is the classification of superheroes as “vigilantes.” In some situations, heroes must even commit crimes themselves, such as assault or battery, in order to confront and neutralize the threats they face.

However, as the superhero comics gained popularity, a lot of what could be published regarding the “superhero” was put into question. Traditionally, a superhero’s job is to combat an evil presented in society, more often than not in some kind of extraordinary, yet technically vigilante way. Furthermore, the kinds of people who were often considered “evil” were put into question; superhero comic publishers were not allowed to villainize the government, and while large corporate authorities were technically allowed to be ridiculed, the extent of which this could happen quickly became controversial.

This is an example of a superhero comic cover, depicting Superman, one of many heroes.
