# Crime and Horror Comics

In the 1940s and 50s, the genre of horror and crime gained significant popularity in the realm of American comics. Following the second world war, the focus of public attention shifted away from the bright themes of hope and justice of the superhero genre to darker, more sinister stories. As the genre developed, concern was raised over the controversial content featured in these comics. While typically intended for older audiences, many books featured detailed depictions of crime, violence, gore, supernatural elements and excessively gruesome scenes. Concerns about the impact of these books on children eventually lead to the self-censorship of these themes through the Comic Code Authority in 1954. While necessary for the survival of the comic book industry, this censorship is largely seen as the reason why crime and horror comics never reached the prominence that they enjoyed during the 40s and 50s.
 
It’s impossible to discuss crime and horror comics without examining potentially the most notable publisher in the industry, EC Comics. After the untimely death of his father, William Gaines inherited “Educational Comics,” known for producing “Picture Stories from the Bible” and a number of other illustrative works (Hajdu). He left his company to his son who was planning to be a high school chemistry teacher before the accident. He, Al Feldstein, and Harvey Kurtzman began producing some of the most well known horror comics under the new name, “Entertaining Comics.” The idea of a horror comic was rather straightforward with the comic including supernatural forces like magic, witches, vampires, werewolves etc. Paving the way for today’s distinction of entertainment between horror and thriller, horror comics almost unflinchingly uses supernatural elements.
